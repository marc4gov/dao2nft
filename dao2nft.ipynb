    "Our model is based on the assumption that the ecosystem will grow when stakeholders thave trust in the value contributors provide for the DAO. Therefore we model an NFT-based approach, where projects that receive grants from the DAO can earn reputation NFTs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These NFTs are minted when a funded project is progressing and delivering value by simple metrics like posting to Discord/Github in a SourceCred-manner, delivering to milestones, finishing in time and reaching ROI. NFTs are then fractioned and distributed to the team members, so they earn reputation value. In next grant rounds these NFTs are signaling voters to trust certain projects or team members holding such NFTs, in order to accumulate Yes-votes for these projects where team members participate in.\n",
